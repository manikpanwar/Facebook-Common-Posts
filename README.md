# Facebook-Common-Posts
Scrapes Facebook pages and determines common posts contained in the pages (based on text) and stores them using mongodb

Dependencies:

Python Facebook SDK : https://github.com/pythonforfacebook/facebook-sdk
PyMongo: https://api.mongodb.org/python/current/installation.html

You will also need a facebook access token to run this which can be obtained at the facebook developers website.

Usage:

Open terminal and run the following command

mongod --dbpath <path-where-you-want-to-store-data>

eg. In your project folder
mkdir data
mongod --dbpath ./data

Once mongo is running in terminal, run the script to store the common posts among facebook pages you specify.

Run time:

This runs in O(N) run time; where N is the total number of posts among all facebook pages.
